Several approaches can resolve this issue:

1. **Check Expo SDK Version Compatibility:** Ensure all your dependencies are compatible with the Expo SDK version specified in your `package.json` and `app.json` files.  Refer to the documentation for each library to confirm compatibility.
2. **Update Expo SDK:** Consider upgrading your Expo SDK to the latest stable version. This often resolves compatibility issues. Run `expo upgrade` in your project's root directory.
3. **Update Dependencies:**  Upgrade all your project's dependencies using `expo install` to fetch the latest versions. This should address dependency conflicts in some cases.
4. **Use Expo Go:** Try running the application in Expo Go. If it works there, it might be a development environment issue, not directly related to code.  Troubleshooting may focus on your IDE, build system or dependencies related to those.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes a clean build can resolve issues caused by cached files or conflicting dependencies. Run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start`.
6. **Examine Package.json and app.json:** Carefully review your `package.json` to find dependencies with conflicting requirements.  Similarly, check `app.json` for any settings that may be causing incompatibility.
7. **Consult Library Documentation:** If a particular library is causing problems, carefully read its documentation for compatibility information and any known issues with Expo.
8. **Search for Similar Issues:** Search for the specific error message or related issues on the Expo forums, GitHub, or Stack Overflow. Often, others have encountered and solved the same problem.
